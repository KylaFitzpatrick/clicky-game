### About the app 
 This is a clicky game app with Create React App and is a memory game based on guessing animal images.

### High-level overview of how the app is organized

Clicky game is a game app that renders random animal images to the page. 

### How the app works

1. Click an image to begin the game 
2. User's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
3. User's score will be reset to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once. 
4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle in a random order.
5. User's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
